# About Me

I'm a Lead NLP Data Scientist at Shelf with 7+ years of experience in Machine Learning and Generative AI. I specialize in building production-ready AI systems, particularly conversational AI and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems.

Currently, I lead the development of "Search Copilot," a conversational AI system that handles 120K+ monthly queries with a 64% positive response rate across 5K active users.

## What I Do

- **Team Leadership**: Leading cross-functional teams and supervising ML engineers
- **Research**: Published at ACL 2022, focusing on sequence tagging and grammatical error correction
- **Production AI**: Building and deploying large-scale ML systems from ideation to production
- **LLM Development**: Fine-tuning models like Llama2 7B using PEFT techniques
- **Teaching**: Guest lecturer on NLP at Ukrainian Catholic University

## Technical Focus

My expertise spans NLP, machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), LLM technologies (LangChain, transformers), and cloud infrastructure (AWS, Vertex AI). I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical AI applications.
